Android app for working with [[https://github.com/lepisma/pile][pile]]. There are two primary goals for this project:

1. Make [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]] workflows work well on the go. Orgzly doesn't work here and I
   don't want to use unstable hacks using say logseq for doing this. This last
   point might be weak, in that case I would fall on the next point to justify
   why I am building this.
2. Learn Android development. It's been a long time since I learnt something new
   in programming.

As of now, it can display my notes, allow title search, and lets me edit and
capture new items. I am now using it on a daily basis and will be updating based
on my needs. Here are a few screenshots:
